## What it does?
Is a simple way to visualize your commits just like github does, cause you know, some times we just want some unusefull data.

If you work in a team, the dashboard will show all your teammates and you will be able to visualize them info too.

## What do you need?
 - Modern browser
 
## To Run!
Oohhh, it's gonna be hard...just open index.html!
 
### WARN..3 things:
 - all commits are counted, no matter if the commit was merged with master or not...this tool will just count all of them. 
 - if you do not have a super computer and you have more than  millions of code lines, been warned that if you turn on "count diff lines" you may break your browser.
 - its not a safe application to install in a server, download and run just in your machine.


**Thats it folks, 
feel free to download, comment and commit.**

##### enjoy!
